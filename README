This is a github mirror of the OCMock framework found at http://www.mulle-kybernetik.com/software/OCMock/

The repository was cloned from the svn repository at http://svn.mulle-kybernetik.com/OCMock/trunk/

hopefully this will allow regular updates to the github version, buy pulling anything from svn and pushing to github
